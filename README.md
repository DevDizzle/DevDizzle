# Evan Parra 👋

### ML Engineer | Building Production AI Systems on GCP

I build end-to-end ML systems that ship to production. My focus is autonomous pipelines, MLOps, and LLM-powered applications on **Google Cloud Platform**.

**MS in Artificial Intelligence (FAU, 2025) | Google Certified ML Engineer**

---

## 🔧 What I Build

| Area | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **ML Pipelines** | End-to-end data ingestion → feature engineering → model deployment |
| **LLM Applications** | RAG systems, prompt chaining, MCP tool servers |
| **MLOps** | CI/CD for ML, model versioning, monitoring, cost optimization |
| **Data Engineering** | BigQuery, ETL/ELT pipelines, real-time processing |
