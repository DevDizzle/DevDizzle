# Hi, I'm Evan ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to Dev Dizzle's Repo!

I build intelligent, end-to-end AI systems on Google Cloud that solve real-world business problems. From data pipelines to full-stack applications, I love shipping products that work.

## About Me

I'm an Applied AI Engineer with a strong bias for shipping products. My journey includes founding and scaling an e-commerce business to over **$1M/yr in revenue**, which taught me the importance of building solutions that deliver measurable results. I'm currently completing my **M.S. in Artificial Intelligence** at Florida Atlantic University (expected 2025) and enjoy tackling complex challenges at the intersection of machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and user-centric design.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few projects I've built and deployed from the ground up.
