Hi, I'm a Master's candidate in Artificial Intelligence at FAU (expected 2025). I'm passionate about building practical AI solutionsâ€”from skin lesion detection and financial analysis bots to route optimization platforms. I work with machine learning, cloud technologies, and full-stack development, always learning and exploring new ideas. Welcome to my GitHub!
