## What I do
- **ML + MLOps on GCP:** Vertex AI, BigQuery, Cloud Run/Functions, Workflows, Pub/Sub, KFP.
- **Data platforms:** pipelines, feature stores, analytics & dashboards.
- **Productization:** ship web apps with Firebase (auth/hosting), Stripe, and clean UX.

## Selected work (live demos)
### üü© ProfitScout ‚Äî AI stock analysis (Russell-1000)
**Live:** https://profitscout.app  
Signals and explanations from fundamentals (SEC 10-K/10-Q), earnings calls, and technicals.  
**Stack:** Vertex AI (HPO & embeddings), BigQuery, Cloud Run/Functions, KFP, Firebase, Stripe.  
**Highlights:** multi-agent summarization, calibrated ensembles, experiment tracking.

### ü©∫ MaculaCutis ‚Äî Dermatology second-opinion (MVP)
**Live:** https://MaculaCutis.com  
Dermoscopic image triage with explainability overlays (SHAP).  
**Stack:** Vertex AI AutoML Vision, GCS, Dataflow/Beam, Firebase.

## Public repos (a few you can browse)
- **ML pipeline:** `profitscout-ml-pipeline` (Vertex AI + KFP training/HPO + calibrated ensembles)  
- **Data ingestion:** `profitscout-data-pipeline` (SEC filings, earnings transcripts, technicals)  
- **Frontend:** `profit-scout-firebase` (Firebase Hosting/Auth, Stripe subscription)

---

## Recent highlights
- Built end-to-end **Vertex AI** pipelines (training, daily inference, weekly retraining) with artifacts in GCS and metrics in BigQuery.  
- Designed multi-service GCP architecture (Cloud Run/Functions, Eventarc, Workflows, Pub/Sub).  
- Prior founder/operator (**Rapid CPAP**) with **$1M/yr** revenue; strong bias to ship.

## Skills
**Cloud:** GCP (Vertex AI, BigQuery, Cloud Run/Functions, Workflows, Pub/Sub, Dataflow/Beam)  
**ML:** XGBoost, sklearn, PyTorch/TensorFlow, calibration, HPO, embeddings/RAG  
**Data:** pipelines, feature engineering, SQL/BigQuery, orchestration, experiment tracking  
**Web:** React, Firebase (Auth/Hosting), Stripe, REST, JSON/NDJSON

---
## Currently
- Hardening ProfitScout pipelines: adding retrieval-quality evaluations, cost controls, and an options screening pipeline
- Completing M.S. in Artificial Intelligence at Florida Atlantic University (FAU), expected 2025
